ðŸŽ® It is a multiplayer game

ðŸ“– The game starts with a story that has several blank spaces in it.  
Each blank is labeled with a part of speech that you have to fill.  
The players don't know the context of the story.   
Once all the blanks are filled in, the story is read out loud, often with hilarious results. The story usually doesn't make much sense, because the words provided by the players are often nonsensical or inappropriate for the context.
