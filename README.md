# Python Project Triad

This repository contains three beginner-friendly Python mini-projects:
1. [Pig](pig/pig.md)
2. [Madlibs Generator](madlibs-generator/madlibs_generator.md)
3. [Math Quiz](math-quiz/math_quiz.md)


These simple projects help you apply your learning without overwhelming you. You almost always get to learn something new with each project.  
My favorite was the Math Quiz.

Enjoy! üòÅ
