# Python Project Triad

This repo consists of three beginner friendly python mini-mini-projects:
1. [pig](pig/pig.md)
2. [madlibs generator](madlibs-generator/madlibs_generator.md)
3. [math quiz](math-quiz/math_quiz.md)


A simple project like these helps you apply your learnings without overwhelming you. And you almost always get to learn something new with each project.  
My favorite was math lib.

Enjoy! üòÅ
